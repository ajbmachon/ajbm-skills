# Offer Creation Workflow

Guided process for creating irresistible offers using Alex Hormozi's methodology.

## How to Use This Workflow

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes for all phases

**Progress tracking:** Each phase shows `[Phase X/6]` so users know where they are.

**Checkpoints:** After Phases 2, 4, and 6, offer to save progress: *"Want to pause here and continue later? I can summarize what we have so far."*

**Depth principle:** Keep probing each question until you reach **emotional stakes** (fear, frustration, embarrassment) or **financial stakes** (specific dollar amounts, lost revenue). Surface answers aren't enough.

**Cross-reference:** For deeper explanation of any framework, see [frameworks-reference.md](frameworks-reference.md).

**Tell the user:** "This is the complete framework. By default, we'll work through all six phases. However, if some sections aren't relevant to your offer, let me know which ones to skip."

---

## Section Selection

After showing the overview, ask:

> "Which phases would you like to work through? Options:
>
> 1. **All phases** (recommended for new offers)
> 2. **Specific phases only** - tell me which numbers
> 3. **Skip specific phases** - tell me which to exclude
>
> What would you like to do?"

Proceed with the selected phases in order.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation

`[Phase 1/6 — Foundation]`

**Goal:** Define the target customer and their ultimate desired outcome.

**→ Deep dive:** [The Grand Slam Offer](frameworks-reference.md#the-grand-slam-offer)

### Question 1.1: The Avatar
> "Who is your ideal customer? Be specific about:
> - Demographics (age, profession, income level)
> - Current situation (what problem are they facing?)
> - What have they already tried that hasn't worked?"

**Wait for response, then probe deeper if needed:**
- "What keeps them up at night about this problem?"
- "How would they describe this problem to a friend?"

### Question 1.2: The Dream Outcome
> "If your offer worked perfectly, what would their life look like?
> - What specific result would they have?
> - How would they feel?
> - What would become possible that isn't possible now?"

**Capture these elements:**
- [ ] Specific avatar description
- [ ] Current pain/problem
- [ ] Dream outcome (tangible result)
- [ ] Emotional transformation

### Validation: Is This Deep Enough?

Before proceeding, verify:

| Element | Surface (❌ not ready) | Deep (✅ ready) |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Avatar | "Small business owners" | "Restaurant owners, 35-50, $200K-500K revenue, frustrated with no-shows" |
| Pain | "Need more customers" | "Losing $2K/month to empty tables; embarrassed when regulars see the place empty" |
| Dream outcome | "More sales" | "Fully booked Friday-Sunday, 3-month waitlist, featured in local press" |
| Emotion | "Feel better" | "Finally feel like a 'real' restaurant, not just surviving" |

**Depth test:** Have you uncovered a specific dollar amount OR a specific emotional state (embarrassment, fear, frustration, pride)? If not, ask: *"Tell me more about how this affects you day-to-day..."*

---

## Phase 2: Value Equation

`[Phase 2/6 — Value Equation]`

**Goal:** Maximize perceived value by optimizing all four variables.

**→ Deep dive:** [The Value Equation](frameworks-reference.md#the-value-equation)

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

### Question 2.1: Dream Outcome Enhancement
> "You mentioned their dream outcome is [X]. Let's make it more compelling:
> - Can we make the result more specific or measurable?
> - Can we add an emotional or status element?
> - What's the 'dream' version of this outcome?"

### Question 2.2: Perceived Likelihood
> "Why should they believe this will work for *them*? Consider:
> - What proof do you have? (testimonials, case studies, data)
> - What credentials or experience do you have?
> - What makes your method different from what they've tried?"

**If they lack proof:** "What could you guarantee or demonstrate to increase their belief?"

### Question 2.3: Time Delay
> "How quickly can they expect to see results?
> - What's the first result they'll notice? How soon?
> - What's the timeline to the full outcome?
> - Can any part be accelerated?"

**Push for speed:** "What would it take to get them [first result] in the first week/day/hour?"

### Question 2.4: Effort & Sacrifice
> "What will they have to do or give up to get this result?
> - Time commitment?
> - Money (besides your offer)?
> - Lifestyle changes?
> - Learning curve?"

**Reduce friction:** "What could you do FOR them to reduce their effort? What 'done-for-you' elements could you add?"

**Capture these elements:**
- [ ] Enhanced dream outcome statement
- [ ] Proof/credibility elements
- [ ] Speed claims (first result + full result)
- [ ] Effort reduction strategies

### Validation: Value Equation Check

Score each variable 1-10:

| Variable | Score | Improvement Needed? |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Dream Outcome (specific, measurable, emotional) | /10 | |
| Perceived Likelihood (proof, credentials, differentiation) | /10 | |
| Time Delay (first win speed, full result timeline) | /10 | |
| Effort Reduction (done-for-you elements) | /10 | |

**Target:** Each variable should score 7+. If any scores below 7, probe deeper before continuing.

### ⏸️ Checkpoint

> "We've defined your ideal customer and optimized the value equation. Want to pause here and continue later? I can summarize what we have so far."

---

## Phase 3: Risk Reversal

`[Phase 3/6 — Risk Reversal]`

**Goal:** Remove the prospect's fear of making a wrong decision.

**→ Deep dive:** [Guarantee Frameworks](frameworks-reference.md#guarantee-frameworks)

### Question 3.1: Identify the Risk
> "What is your prospect most afraid of?
> - Wasting money?
> - Wasting time?
> - Looking foolish?
> - It not working for their specific situation?"

### Question 3.2: Guarantee Type
> "Based on that fear, which guarantee type fits best?
>
> 1. **Unconditional** - 'Money back, no questions asked'
>    - Best for: Low-risk offers, building trust, first-time buyers
>
> 2. **Conditional** - 'Do X, Y, Z and if it doesn't work, money back'
>    - Best for: Weeding out non-action-takers, higher-ticket offers
>
> 3. **Outcome-Based** - 'Get [specific result] or money back'
>    - Best for: High confidence in delivery, premium positioning
>
> 4. **Anti-Guarantee** - 'All sales final' (scarcity play)
>    - Best for: Ultra-premium, proven demand, exclusivity
>
> Which resonates with your offer and audience?"

### Question 3.3: Guarantee Enhancement
> "How can we make the guarantee even stronger?
> - Longer timeframe? (30 days → 365 days)
> - Keep the bonuses even if they refund?
> - Double money back if conditions met?"

### Guarantee Templates (Fill-in-the-Blank)

Choose the appropriate template based on the selected guarantee type:

**1. Unconditional Template:**
> "Try [OFFER NAME] for [TIME PERIOD]. If you're not completely satisfied for ANY reason, simply [REFUND PROCESS] for a full refund. No questions asked, no hoops to jump through."

**2. Conditional Template:**
> "Complete [SPECIFIC ACTIONS], and if you don't [SPECIFIC RESULT], I'll [REFUND/CONTINUE WORKING]. You must [CONDITIONS] to qualify for the guarantee."

**3. Outcome-Based Template:**
> "Get [SPECIFIC MEASURABLE RESULT] within [TIME PERIOD], or [CONSEQUENCE: refund / work free until you do / double money back]. That's how confident I am this works."

**4. Anti-Guarantee Template:**
> "Due to [LEGITIMATE REASON: limited spots / exclusive access / intensive support], all sales are final. This ensures only committed [AVATARS] join, which protects the experience for everyone."

**Capture these elements:**
- [ ] Primary fear identified
- [ ] Guarantee type selected
- [ ] Guarantee terms/conditions (use template above)
- [ ] Enhancement elements

---

## Phase 4: Value Stack

`[Phase 4/6 — Value Stack]`

**Goal:** Build a stack of components that increases perceived value far beyond the price.

**→ Deep dive:** [Value Stack Construction](frameworks-reference.md#value-stack-construction)

### Question 4.1: Core Offer
> "What is the core deliverable? The main thing they're paying for?"

### Question 4.2: Obstacle Identification
> "What obstacles might prevent them from getting the full result from your core offer?
> - Knowledge gaps?
> - Tool or resource needs?
> - Accountability issues?
> - Specific situations not covered?"

**List 3-5 obstacles.**

### Question 4.3: Bonus Creation
> "For each obstacle, what could you add to eliminate it?
>
> Obstacle: [X]
> → Bonus: [what would solve this?]
>
> Think about:
> - Checklists, templates, scripts
> - Training modules
> - Access to tools or software
> - Community or support
> - Done-for-you elements"

### Question 4.4: Bonus Valuation
> "For each bonus, what would someone pay for this separately?
>
> - [Bonus 1]: $___
> - [Bonus 2]: $___
> - [Bonus 3]: $___
> - Total value: $___
>
> Rule of thumb: Total stack value should be 10x+ your asking price."

**Capture these elements:**
- [ ] Core offer description
- [ ] 3-5 obstacles identified
- [ ] Bonus for each obstacle
- [ ] Value assigned to each bonus
- [ ] Total stack value

### ⏸️ Checkpoint

> "We've built your value stack with [X] bonuses totaling $[X] in value. Want to pause here and continue later? I can summarize what we have so far."

---

## Phase 5: Scarcity & Urgency

`[Phase 5/6 — Scarcity & Urgency]`

**Goal:** Create legitimate reasons for limited availability and immediate action.

**→ Deep dive:** [Scarcity & Urgency](frameworks-reference.md#scarcity--urgency)

### Question 5.1: Scarcity (Why Limited?)
> "Is there a genuine reason this offer is limited?
>
> **Capacity-based:**
> - Limited spots due to personal attention required?
> - Physical inventory limits?
> - Cohort or class size limits?
>
> **Access-based:**
> - Exclusive to certain people?
> - Requires qualification?
>
> If no natural scarcity exists, that's okay—not every offer needs it."

### Question 5.2: Urgency (Why Now?)
> "Is there a genuine reason to act now?
>
> **Time-based:**
> - Price increases after date?
> - Bonus expires?
> - Enrollment window closes?
>
> **Event-based:**
> - Cohort starts on specific date?
> - Tied to a season or event?
>
> **Consequence-based:**
> - What do they lose by waiting?
> - Cost of inaction?"

### Ethical Check
> "Important: Only use scarcity/urgency that's TRUE. Fake scarcity destroys trust and kills long-term business. Is everything we've discussed genuinely limited or time-sensitive?"

**Capture these elements:**
- [ ] Scarcity mechanism (if applicable)
- [ ] Urgency mechanism (if applicable)
- [ ] Ethical verification

---

## Phase 6: Naming & Pricing

`[Phase 6/6 — Naming & Pricing]`

**Goal:** Create a compelling name and set value-based pricing.

**→ Deep dive:** [MAGIC Naming Formula](frameworks-reference.md#magic-naming-formula) | [Pricing Psychology](frameworks-reference.md#pricing-psychology)

### Question 6.1: MAGIC Name Formula

> "Let's name your offer using the MAGIC formula:
>
> - **M**ake a reason to pay attention (pattern interrupt)
> - **A**nnounce the avatar (who it's for)
> - **G**ive them a goal (what they'll achieve)
> - **I**ndicate time interval (how fast)
> - **C**omplete with container word (program, system, challenge, etc.)
>
> Example: '6-Week Lean Body Challenge for Busy Moms'
>
> Let's build yours:
> - Who is it for?
> - What will they achieve?
> - In what timeframe?
> - What container word fits? (Program, System, Challenge, Blueprint, Accelerator, Bootcamp, Masterclass...)"

### Question 6.2: Pricing

**Two types of value to consider:**

| Value Type | What It Means | Example |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| **Outcome Value** | What achieving the dream outcome is WORTH to them (revenue, savings, time, emotional) | "Getting 10 new customers/month = $50K/year in revenue" |
| **Stack Value** | The sum of what each component would cost separately | "Core offer ($3K) + Bonus 1 ($500) + Bonus 2 ($300) = $3,800" |

**Pricing formula:**

```
Step 1: Calculate Outcome Value
   → What is the dream outcome worth annually? $______

Step 2: Calculate Stack Value
   → Sum of all components priced separately: $______

Step 3: Set Price Using BOTH
   → Price should be 10-20% of Outcome Value
   → Price should make Stack Value ratio 3:1 or higher (ideally 10:1)
   → Use the LOWER of these two calculations as your ceiling
```

**Example:**
- Outcome Value: $50,000/year → 10% = $5,000 ceiling
- Stack Value: $8,000 → At $2,000 price = 4:1 ratio ✅
- Price: $1,997 (under both ceilings, strong ratios)

> "Let's calculate your price:
>
> 1. What is achieving the dream outcome worth to them annually? $___
> 2. What's your total value stack worth? $___
> 3. What price is 10-20% of the outcome value? $___
> 4. What price gives you at least a 3:1 stack ratio? $___
>
> Based on these calculations, what price point feels like a 'no-brainer'?"

**Capture these elements:**
- [ ] Offer name (MAGIC formula)
- [ ] Outcome value calculation
- [ ] Stack value calculation
- [ ] Price point
- [ ] Outcome-to-price ratio
- [ ] Stack-to-price ratio

### ⏸️ Final Checkpoint

> "We've completed all six phases! Ready to see your complete offer components, or would you like to revisit any phase first?"

```

---

## Synthesis: Final Format

After presenting the structured components, ask:

> "Here are your offer components. Would you like me to synthesize these into a specific format?
>
> Options:
> 1. **Sales page copy** - Full landing page with headline, body, value stack, guarantee, CTA
> 2. **Pitch script** - Verbal script for sales calls or video
> 3. **Email sequence** - Series of emails presenting the offer
> 4. **Pitch deck** - Slides for presentation
> 5. **One-page summary** - Concise overview for internal use
> 6. **Something else** - describe what you need
>
> Which format would you like?"

Then synthesize the components into the requested format, maintaining:
- The value equation optimization
- The specific proof elements
- The exact guarantee terms
- The complete value stack
- The scarcity/urgency elements
- The MAGIC name
