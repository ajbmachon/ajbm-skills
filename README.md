## Usage Guide

Skills are **model-invoked**—Claude automatically uses them based on context. You can also invoke them explicitly using `/skill-name` or by asking Claude to use a specific skill.

### Interview Skill

**Best for:** Planning features, writing specs, fleshing out ideas, requirements gathering

```
I want to build a caching layer for our API - can you help me spec this out?
```

Or invoke directly:
```
/interview
```

**What to expect:**
1. **Research Phase** — Claude does BLOCKING research on your codebase and technologies before asking questions
2. **Devil's Advocate Phase** — Claude challenges your idea: Does this need to exist? Is there a library? What could fail?
3. **Deep Interview Phase** — Once the idea passes challenge, Claude becomes a collaborative partner, asking detailed questions while fact-checking in the background
4. **Output** — A self-contained spec with Problem Statement, Objective, Success Criteria, Interview Record (Q&A), and any corrected assumptions

**Key features:**
- Always verifies technology assumptions against current docs (training data may be stale)
- Surfaces contradictions between your claims and research findings
- Captures Q&A in the spec so future Claude instances can implement without asking questions

### Systematic Debugging Skill

**Best for:** Any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior - BEFORE attempting fixes

```
This test is failing and I don't know why
```

Or when you've already tried fixes:
```
I've tried 3 fixes and nothing is working
```

**The Iron Law:** No fixes without root cause investigation first.

**Four phases:**
1. **Root Cause Investigation** — Read errors, reproduce, trace data flow
2. **Pattern Analysis** — Find working examples, compare differences
3. **Hypothesis Testing** — Single hypothesis, minimal change, verify
4. **Implementation** — Failing test first, single fix, verify

**Key features:**
- Stops "quick fix" instinct that causes thrashing
- After 3+ failed fixes, questions architecture instead of attempting more fixes
- Integrates with test-driven-development and root-cause-tracing skills

### Testing Anti-Patterns Skill

**Best for:** Writing tests, adding mocks, or when tempted to add test-only methods

```
I need to write tests for this component
```

Or when tests are getting complex:
```
My test mocks are getting really complicated
```

**The Iron Laws:**
1. NEVER test mock behavior
2. NEVER add test-only methods to production classes
3. NEVER mock without understanding dependencies

**Catches common mistakes:**
- Asserting on mock elements instead of real behavior
- Adding `destroy()` methods only used in tests
- Over-mocking that breaks test logic
- Incomplete mocks that hide bugs

### Setup Linter Skill

**Best for:** Setting up automatic code linting/formatting when Claude finishes writing code

```
Set up automatic linting for this project
```

Or invoke directly:
```
/setup-linter
```

**What it does:**
1. Auto-detects your project type (JS/TS, Python, Rust, Go, Deno)
2. Installs the appropriate linter if not present
3. Creates config files with sensible defaults
4. Sets up a Stop hook so linting runs automatically after every Claude response

**Supported projects:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript → ESLint (with React detection)
- Python → Ruff
- Rust → rustfmt + clippy
- Go → golangci-lint
- Deno → built-in lint/fmt

### Prompt Craft Skill

**Best for:** Improving prompts, learning prompting techniques, writing prompts for LLMs

```
Help me improve this prompt: "Write a blog post about AI"
```

Or ask for a specific mode:
```
Analyze this prompt and tell me what's weak about it
```

### Authoring Skills Skill

**Best for:** Creating new Claude Code skills, understanding plugin architecture, configuring triggers and hooks

```
I want to create a new Claude Code skill for database migrations
```

### Hormozi Pitch Skill

**Best for:** Creating offers, pricing strategies, marketing copy, value propositions

```
I need to create a compelling offer for my SaaS product
```

### X Post Writer Skill

**Best for:** Twitter/X content, social media copywriting, viral hooks

```
Write a Twitter thread about automation workflows
```

## Skill Details

### interview

A rigorous interview system that produces implementation-ready specs:

**Two-Phase Identity:**
- **Critical Challenger (Phases 1-2)** — Skeptical, probing. Challenges the idea's right to exist. Uses BLOCKING research.
- **Expert Partner (Phase 3+)** — Collaborative, thorough. Helps refine implementation. Uses BACKGROUND research.

**Research Protocol:**
- Pre-challenge: BLOCKING research on codebase, technologies, existing solutions
- During interview: BACKGROUND research to verify claims asynchronously
- Pre-output: Verification research to ensure spec accuracy

**Output includes:**
- Problem Statement, Objective, Success Criteria
- Interview Record (Q&A that led to decisions)
- Assumption Corrections (what user/Claude got wrong)
- Edge Cases, Tradeoffs, Open Questions (when relevant)

### systematic-debugging

Four-phase framework that ensures understanding before fixes:

**The Four Phases:**
| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

**Key rules:**
- No fixes without completing Phase 1
- One variable at a time in Phase 3
- If 3+ fixes failed → question architecture, don't attempt fix #4
- 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation

**Red flags that trigger this skill:**
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- Each fix reveals new problem in different place

### testing-anti-patterns

Prevents common testing mistakes that cause false confidence:

**Anti-patterns caught:**
| Anti-Pattern | What's Wrong | Fix |
|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Testing mock behavior | Verifies mock exists, not real behavior | Test real component or unmock |
| Test-only production methods | Pollutes production with test code | Move to test utilities |
| Mocking without understanding | Over-mocking breaks test logic | Understand dependencies first |
| Incomplete mocks | Partial mocks hide structural assumptions | Mirror real API completely |
| Tests as afterthought | Can't claim complete without tests | TDD - tests first |

**Gate functions:** Each anti-pattern has a "gate function" - questions to ask BEFORE taking action that would introduce the anti-pattern.

### setup-linter

Automated linting setup with Stop hook integration:

**Auto-detection:**
| Project | Detection | Linter | Config Created |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| JavaScript/React | `package.json` | ESLint | `eslint.config.js` |
| Python | `pyproject.toml`, `*.py` | Ruff | `ruff.toml` |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` | rustfmt + clippy | (built-in) |
| Go | `go.mod` | golangci-lint | (optional) |
| Deno | `deno.json` | deno lint/fmt | (built-in) |

**Features:**
- Detects package manager (yarn, pnpm, bun, npm)
- Detects React projects and adds react-hooks plugin
- Creates flat config format for ESLint
- Hook runs `<linter> 2>&1 || true` (never blocks Claude)

### authoring-skills

- SKILL.md best practices (conciseness, 500-line rule, progressive disclosure)
- Plugin development (directory structure, manifests, distribution)
- Trigger configuration (keywords, intent patterns, file paths)
- Hook architecture (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart)
- Testing and troubleshooting workflows

## Tips for Best Results

### Interview Skill
- **Provide context upfront** — The more detail in your initial message, the smarter Claude's research and challenges will be
- **Defend your ideas** — When Claude challenges, explain your reasoning. Ideas that survive become stronger specs
- **Trust the research** — If Claude says "I found library X that does this," consider it seriously
- **Review the spec** — The Interview Record should capture your key decisions. If something's missing, ask to add it

### Debugging & Testing Skills
- **Use systematic-debugging BEFORE attempting fixes** — Even if the fix seems obvious, the process is fast and prevents thrashing
- **If 3+ fixes failed, stop** — This signals an architectural problem, not a bug. Question the pattern.
- **Run tests with real implementations first** — Before mocking, see what actually needs to happen
- **Gate functions prevent mistakes** — Ask the questions before adding mocks or test methods

### General
- **Let skills activate naturally** — You don't need to explicitly invoke skills; Claude uses them based on context
- **Combine skills** — You can use interview to spec a feature, then prompt-craft to write prompts for that feature
- **Check for updates** — Skills improve over time. Run `/plugin marketplace update` periodically
