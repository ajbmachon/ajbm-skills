# Alex Hormozi Pitch Methodology

Create irresistible offers using proven frameworks from *$100M Offers*.

## When This Skill Activates

**Trigger keywords:** offer, pitch, pricing, guarantee, value proposition, bonuses, scarcity, urgency, irresistible offer, Grand Slam Offer, value stack, lead magnet, high-ticket, sales page, upsell, downsell

**Use cases:**
- Creating new offers, pitches, or value propositions
- Designing pricing or guarantee structures
- Building value stacks with bonuses
- Naming products, programs, or services (MAGIC formula)
- Adding scarcity and urgency ethically
- Optimizing or auditing existing offers
- Writing sales copy, landing pages, or pitch decks

## The Core Insight

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

To create an irresistible offer, maximize the top (what they get, belief it works) and minimize the bottom (how long it takes, how hard it is). Every element of your offer should move these levers.

## What You Can Do

### Create a New Offer
**→ Read [workflow.md](workflow.md)**

Guided Socratic process that:
1. Shows you the full framework overview
2. Lets you select which sections are relevant
3. Walks through each section with targeted questions
4. Outputs structured components
5. Synthesizes into your desired format (sales page, pitch, etc.)

### Answer Framework Questions
**→ Read [frameworks-reference.md](frameworks-reference.md)**

Deep methodology reference covering:
- Value Equation (complete breakdown)
- Four Guarantee Types
- MAGIC Naming Formula
- Value Stack Construction
- Scarcity & Urgency Types
- Pricing Psychology

### Optimize an Existing Offer
**→ Read [workflow.md](workflow.md)**, then select only the sections that need improvement.

## Quick Framework Reference

| Framework | Purpose | Key Question |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Value Equation** | Maximize perceived value | How can we increase outcome/likelihood and decrease time/effort? |
| **Guarantees** | Remove risk | What risk is the prospect afraid of? |
| **MAGIC Naming** | Create compelling names | Does the name announce who it's for and what they'll achieve? |
| **Value Stack** | Justify pricing | What's the total value of everything included? |
| **Scarcity** | Limit availability | Why can't everyone get this? |
| **Urgency** | Limit time | Why must they act now? |

## The "Stupid Not To" Test

A Grand Slam Offer passes this test: *"The prospect would feel stupid saying no."*

If your offer doesn't pass this test, revisit the Value Equation. Either:
- The dream outcome isn't compelling enough
- They don't believe it will work for them
- It takes too long to see results
- It requires too much effort or sacrifice
